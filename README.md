# Road-Accident-Analysis
This project aims to analyze and visualize road accident data from various countries and regions using popular tools like Power BI, SQL, and Excel. The data is sourced from the World Health Organization's (WHO) [Global Status Report on Road Safety 2018].<br><br>

# Data Extraction, Transformation, and Loading (ETL)
The first step of this project is to extract, transform, and load the data using SQL queries. The data is stored in a relational database with the following tables:

countries: contains information about the countries and regions, such as name, population, income level, etc.
deaths: contains information about the number of road traffic deaths by country and year, from 2013 to 2016.
factors: contains information about the risk factors and measures related to road safety, such as speed limit, seat-belt wearing rate, helmet-wearing rate, etc.
The SQL queries are used to perform various operations on the data, such as:

Joining the tables using primary and foreign keys
Filtering the data based on certain criteria
Aggregating the data using groups and having clauses
Calculating new columns using arithmetic and logical operators
Sorting the data using order by clause
Limiting the number of rows using a limit clause
The SQL queries are written in a file named queries.sql, which can be executed using any SQL client or tool.<br><br>

# Data Analysis and Visualization
The next step of this project is to analyze and visualize the data using the powerful features of Power BI, Tableau, and Excel. The tools are used to create interactive dashboards and reports that can answer various questions and insights about road accident data, such as:

* What are the global trends and patterns of road traffic deaths?
* Which countries and regions have the highest and lowest rates of road traffic deaths?
* How do the income levels and geographic locations affect the road safety situation?
* What are the main risk factors and measures related to road safety?
* How effective are the interventions and policies implemented by different countries and regions?
<br>
The tools are used to create various types of charts and graphs, such as:

* Line charts to show the changes over time
* Bar charts to compare the values across categories
* Pie charts to show the proportions of different segments
* Maps to show the spatial distribution of data
* Scatter plots to show the relationship between two variables
* Tables to show the numerical values and details<br>
The tools are also used to apply various features and functions, such as:

* Slicers and filters to allow users to select and view specific data
* Calculated fields and measures to create new metrics and calculations
* Parameters and variables to allow users to input and change values
* Conditional formatting and color scales to highlight and emphasize data
* Tooltips and annotations to provide additional information and context
<br><br>

<P>The dashboards and reports are saved in files named powerbi.pbix, tableau.twbx, and excel.xlsx, which can be opened using Power BI Desktop, Tableau Desktop, and Excel respectively.</P>
